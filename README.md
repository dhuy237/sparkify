# Sparkify

This repository is the work for my capstone project from the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. In this project, I will analyze the data from Sparkify to predict customer churn.

Sparkify is a simulation data of a subscription-based company that provide music service like Spotify, Apple Music, etc. Customer churn prediction is a very challenging and common task for a data scientist or analyst to improve a company's business. Processing and analyzing a large amount of data with Spark is also a must-have skill in the data fields.
